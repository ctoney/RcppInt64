### Motivation

While has no _native_ support for 64-bit integer values, the [`bit64`
package](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/bit64/index.html) by Jens OehlschlÃ¤gel is widely
used to fill this gap by (very carefully) passing the bitmaps of `int64_t` values around in
`double`.  This works on the R side by virtue of a S3 call `integer64`, on the C/C++ side the values
can be past by `memcpy`.   What one cannot do is simply copying or casting: the tradeoff made in
representing a `double` with as large a range is that the 'delta' between values is not constant
acros the range and naive casting between both representation *will* be lossy and distort values.

This package contains a handful of very simple helper functions previously floating around in helper
header files in different packages, and reorganizes them along with a few proper unit tests.  The
header provided here can be included directly.

## Example

The example for the included demonstration function show how a vector of
`integer64` values (here spanning the power of 10 ranging from 0 to 18)
can be received in C++, altered (where we just add one) and returned, all
while maintaining `integer64` aka `int64_t` type.

```r
> example(Int64toInt64)

I64I64> # generate all powers of 10 fro 0 .. 18
I64I64> v <- bit64::as.integer64(10^seq(0,18))

I64I64> # pass them to function which will add one to each, print  and return
I64I64> Int64toInt64(v)
